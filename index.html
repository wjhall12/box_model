      <h1>Box Model</h1>
      <p>Play around in the css and change the width, margin, padding, and border then inspect the code in a browser to see how it changes the div and how it's affected. Remember if you wanted specify a specific size you can choose to use border-top to only add border to the the top or padding-right to only add padding to the right. And for all 4 sides starting from the top then right, then bottom then left. So let's say you wanted a border to havea width of (border-width: 0px 10px 20px 30px) It would be 0 border at the top, 10px on the left, 20px at the bottom and 30 px on the right. This can be done for padding as well. Just remember to go clockwise as you are affecting the dimensions of the 4 sides. If you wanted to affect the sides you can choose to say padding: 5 10px; for instance. This would mean that you are adding 5 px at the top and bottom and 10 px on the left and right.  </p>
